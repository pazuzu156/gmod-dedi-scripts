This repo is for installing/running gmod dedicaded server

Scripts are a mix of shell/bash (for windows cause I haven't done this on linux yet)

windows bash scripts are marked as *-win.sh. Batch..of course... .bat

To install, run: `$ ./updater-win.sh -i`

To run, just double clock the run.bat

Run `$ ./clean-win.sh` to remove all instances of the server AND steamcmd files (minus steamcmd.exe of source)

steamcmd.exe is NOT included in the repo. Open steam/download.me to get the latest steamcmd.exe file from Steam
